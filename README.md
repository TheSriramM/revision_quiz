# SQL Assesment

A quiz database that I'm working on to help students revise for their exams.

In my Python/Database program, I have two python programs that are suited for different purposes. revision_quiz.py is the command line code where you receive output on the command line and app.py is the Flask program where you reveive output on a web server.

Please run the app.py file which is the Flask Program.
